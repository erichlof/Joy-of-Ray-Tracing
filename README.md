# The Joy of Ray Tracing

A video series in which we make several types of Ray Tracers, from scratch!

<br>

This GitHub repository contains the complete source code and examples for everything we do in each video episode.  The Joy Of Ray Tracing YouTube video series and this matching GitHub repo are organized in a 'book'-type fashion, with major Chapters (numbered from 0 to ..?) and numerous Episodes/Sections inside each Chapter (similarly numbered from 0 to ..?).  For example, the very first video in the very first chapter would be called Chapter_0_Episode_0 on YouTube, and the corresponding folder path here on GitHub would be '/Chapter_0/Episode_0/' .  The next video in the series would be Chapter_0_Episode_1 on YouTube, and so forth.

<h3> Feel free to skip over Chapter 0 if you are fairly experienced with web development and have a coding environment already set up (like VS Code)
</h3>

<br>
Note: This series really starts 'from scratch', so Chapter 0 is all about installing and setting up a good productive coding environment (mainly VS Code and some of its plugins), then learning about making a basic HTML webpage shell that will eventually hold all of our fancy Ray Tracers.  Along with a quick intro to HTML, I go over very basic styling with CSS stylesheets, as well as a basic intro to JavaScript and how it gives functionality to our simple webpage shell.  Also in Chapter 0, I give an intro to the Canvas element with its Canvas '2d' context for drawing graphics in the browser.  Therefore, if you are an experienced web developer who already has a coding environment set up on your computer (like VS Code with Live Server preview plugin, etc.), and are familiar with basic HTML, basic CSS, and basic JavaScript, and how to draw to a filled rectangle to a Canvas element on your webpage, then you can safely skip Chapter 0.  In this case, feel free to start at Chapter 1, where we start introducing Ray Tracing-specific topics and techniques.
