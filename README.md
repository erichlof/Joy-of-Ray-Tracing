# The Joy of Ray Tracing

A video series in which we make several types of Ray Tracers, from scratch!

<br>

This GitHub repository conatains the complete source code and examples for everything we do in the video episodes.  The YouTube video series and this matching GitHub
repo are organized in a 'book'-type fashion, with major Chapters (numbered 0 to ..?) and numerous Episodes (Sections) within each Chapter, similarly numbered from 
(0 to ..?).  For example the very first video in the very first chapter would be called Chapter_0_Episode_0 on YouTube, and the corresponding path on GitHub would be 
'/Chapter_0/Episode_0'
